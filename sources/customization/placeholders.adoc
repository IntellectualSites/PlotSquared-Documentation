== Introduction

[NOTE]
The placeholder integration allows you to display data from other plugins in specific locations in PlotSquared.

For example, with https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/featherboard.2691[FeatherBoard] you can create a scoreboard (sideboard) with the info about the plot you're standing on. And with using https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/[PlaceholderAPI], you can do `/plot flag set greeting Welcome %player_name%` which translates to "Welcome Steve" when the player Steve enters a plot. +
The `Player` expansion from PlaceholderAPI is required to be installed.

Currently, (FeatherBoard and) PlaceholderAPI placeholders, can be used in the `greeting` and `farewell` flag of a plot.

== Setup

PlotSquared has explicit and official support for https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/[*PlaceholderAPI*] and https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mvdwplaceholderapi.11182/[*MVdWPlaceholderAPI*].

Follow the instruction of these placeholder systems to install it correctly.

[NOTE]
For the PlaceholderAPI placeholders of PlotSquared you don't need to download a PAPI expansion. As opposed to some other plugins, PlotSquared handles everything internally.

== Placeholder Deactivation in PlotSquared

Placeholders can be turned off in `settings.yml`:

=== Chat-System

If you're using *EssentialsChat* and *PlaceholderAPI*, you must install https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatinjector.38327/[*ChatInjector*] in order for the placeholders to show up in the chat. However, please note it has been reported that ChatInjector might cause issues.
