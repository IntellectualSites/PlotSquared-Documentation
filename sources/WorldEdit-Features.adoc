[TIP]
If you want to make other aspects of WorldEdit async as well, you could consider installing https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-async-worldedit.13932[FasAsyncWorldEdit]. All permissions to allow FAWE in plots, you found link:/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit-Documentation/wiki/Permissions[here].

PlotSquared offers several options related to WorldEdit. By default it will do the following if you don't have the bypass permission:

* Restrict WorldEdit to plots
* Block access to potentially harmful WorldEdit commands
* Limits the max iterations with several brushes so people can't crash the server
* Limits the max volume to 50 million

The bypass permission is `plots.worldedit.bypass`, the use `/plot toggle worldedit` or `/plot wea`

To further extend this, PlotSquared comes with a WE processor you can enable:

* Limits max blockstates and entities with editing (enable chunk-processor)
* Faster and async WorldEdit changes (enable experimental-fast-async-worldedit) (bypass this with `/plot wea`)
